      "Today, the best gaming laptops have enough iron inside that they almost match gaming desktops and no longer pay for malt. Thanks to high-end components designed for mobile needs, such as Nvidia’s RTX graphics cards and AMD Nav , new Intel Comet Lake processors, and high-speed SSDs , many of the laptops are ready for decent gaming performance. The quality differences between portable gaming machines and gaming computers are narrowing in recent years. In fact, today’s best gaming laptops are even better than desktops, as their portable form is capable of racing than the best PC gaming. They are also capable of heavy video editing when needed. So if you’re looking for the right device for a few hours of quality gaming or to prove your skills in the online gaming field, we’ve put together below a list of the best gaming laptops on the market right now. We’ve been testing countless laptops in the delivery of TechRadar for years, so we’ve narrowed down the options for you and listed below the best of the absolute models.",
    whySo: "What Is A Gaming Laptop And How Does It Work?",
    discuss:
      "The gaming industry has made great strides in recent years. In fact, almost half a century has passed since Pong surprised the first gamers and today we are witnessing a real battle between gaming computers and consoles to determine the best platform. If once it was strictly necessary to have a fixed location, today even video games have become pocket-sized, with the Nintendo Switch on one side and the gaming laptop on the other. We are therefore talking about a gaming laptop, a computer that can be used anywhere and therefore allows us to take our favorite video games wherever we go. Unlike a classic laptop, the gaming laptop is characterized by greater hardware power and optimization between internal components that do not look out of place in comparison with stationary workstations. There are countless aspects to consider before a purchase of this type, tests and comparisons to be made, as well as several advantages (and some disadvantages) that we will illustrate later.",

          "The Asus Zephyrus G14 lacks a webcam and Thunderbolt 3 interface, but otherwise it’s an almost perfect laptop. It’s actually so good that the laptop earned our rare five-star rating. The Zephyrus G14 is one of the best laptops of the year and easily the best gaming laptop. The machine achieves top performance in games. The AMD Ryzen 4000 processors and Nvidia RTX 2060 graphics card are enough to run any game smoothly, and the best-in-class battery life allows the laptop to be used for more than just gaming.",
        description2:
          "The display has a fast refresh rate of 120 Hz, so games come to life more smoothly than with standard panels. All of this is packaged in a surprisingly thin and light package. Perhaps the best part, though, is that the machine isn’t particularly expensive in terms of its features. A larger price tag would be easily justified.",
